   Used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning to predict the chances of a patient having pneumonia using X-Rays. The model achieved an F-1 score of 93% and    an accuracy of 90%

# Learnings from the course: 

1. Using linear learning models and then moving on to create Deep Feed Forward Neural Networks. 

2. Understanding in detail the algorithms used to train these networks using Stochastic Gradient Descent and the resulting algorithm called Backprop.

3. Understanding model parameter initialization, underfitting and overfitting are discussed as well as techniques such as Regularization that are used to improve the generalization ability of these models. 

4. Learning about specialized DLN architechures such as :
    (a) Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets)
    (b) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
    (c) Natural Language Processing (NLP)

5. Using DLN tools such as Tensor Flow and Keras, while being able to choose parameters and configure these tools to best suit their applications.
